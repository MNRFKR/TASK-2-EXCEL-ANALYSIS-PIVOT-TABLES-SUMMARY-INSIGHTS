# TASK-2-EXCEL-ANALYSIS-PIVOT-TABLES-SUMMARY-INSIGHTS
Got a dataset from kaggle network ,ensured that the data is cleaned obvious issues like blanks and dealed with wrong date formats, and inconsistant categories before creating pivots also used a formula in the source column..
converted dataset into a table format using insert>table so that the pivot tables auto adjusted before the data is updated,created a pivot table that summarizes total sales categories from highest to lowest to find business driving segments ,created a pivot table that summaraizes total sales by category like dragged the products-category to rows &sum of sales to values, then used sales columns to select to sort out the smallest to largest sales data..
added another pivot table and took the payment method to the columns section ,product category to rows, then sum of sales to values to get a analytics like a analyst and then highlighted top-performing regions using conditional formatting by a colour of my choise to highlight the top 10%..
since my datatset doesn't have region or segment that i took and i replaced them with fields like product-category,device-type, or payment method,however added the wanted options to make the dashboard become interactive and user friendly like a power bi tool in excel itself..
added caluculated columns in the dataset for (profit margin) and pivoting since my dataset doesn't have region,i replaced it with a suitable field like payment method or device type and ..and created a pivot chart i got a clear form view of profitability across categories and got a grand total of selected in the particular options including with a chart with sum of profit of top 10%..
